Q: Terminal vs Command Line vs Shell

Terminal = Tool that you use to type and execute commands. Used to be hardware, now we use "terminal emulator" software.

Command Line = The interface of the terminal. Windows often calls their terminal program the "command line" or "cmd". The 2 terms are used interchangeably.

The Shell = The program that the terminal runs. The "OS" of the terminal.
