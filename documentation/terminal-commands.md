# Common Terminal Commands

## Key Commands & Navigation

Before we look at some common commands, I just want to note a few keyboard commands that are very helpful:

- `Up Arrow`: Will show your last command
- `Down Arrow`: Will show your next command
- `Tab`: Will auto-complete your command
- `Ctrl + L`: Will clear the screen
- `Ctrl + C`: Will cancel a command
- `Ctrl + R`: Will search for a command
- `Ctrl + D`: Will exit the terminal

## Manual Command

On Linux and Mac, the `man` command is used to show the **manual** of any command that you can run in the terminal. So if you wanted to know more about the `ls` command, you could run:

```bash
  man ls
```

Unfortunately, if you are on Windows and using Git Bash, the `man` command is not included, however, you can just type the command that you want to know more about and then `--help` and you will get similar info:

```bash
  ls --help
```

You should be able to use the arrow keys or page up and down. When you are ready to exit, just press `q`.

## The `whoami` Command

The `whoami` command will show you the current user that you are logged in as.

```bash
  whoami
```

## The `date` Command

Another really simple one is the `date` command, which, surprise, will show you the current date and time.

```bash
  date
```

## File System Navigation

Commands to navigate your file system are very important. You will be using them all the time. You won't remember every single command that you use, but these are the ones that you should remember.

| Command                             | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pwd                                 | Lists the path to the working directory                                           |
| ls                                  | List directory contents                                                           |
| ls -a                               | List contents including hidden files (Files that begin with a dot)                |
| ls -l                               | List contents with more info including permissions (long listing)                 |
| ls -r                               | List contents reverse order                                                       |
| cd                                  | Change directory to home                                                          |
| cd [dirname]                        | Change directory to specific directory                                            |
| cd ~                                | Change to home directory                                                          |
| cd ..                               | Change to parent directory                                                        |
| cd -                                | Change to previous directory (which could be different than the parent of course) |
| find [dirtosearch] -name [filename] | Find location of a program                                                        |

Of course, you can group flags together. For example, if I want to see more info and view hidden files, I could do `ls -l -a` and even shorten it to `ls -la`.

## Opening a Folder or File

If you want to open a file or a folder in the GUI from your terminal, the command is different depending on the OS.

Mac - `open [dirname]`
Windows - `start [dirname]`
Linux - `xdg-open [dirname]`

You can open folders, files and even URLs

```bash
  open https://github.com/nanishat
```
